Assumptions:
- Everything is done in the same Render Pass, that has a single subpass and only a color 
attachment.
- One single type of Vertex is used, that has Position, Normal Vector and UV coordinates.
- Only Indexed Trianlge lists primitives are used.
- Each Pipeline has a different and personal Pipeline Layout.
- All Pipeliens have only a Vertex and a Fragment shader, both starting with main()
- Only two types of descriptors are allowed: uniforms and combined images and samplers
- All Meshes and Textures needs to be loaded from the beginning, and be in the scene for the 
whole time. However, plese remember that objects might always be hidden by bringing them 
"off-screen" (with coordinates fruther than the far plane)
